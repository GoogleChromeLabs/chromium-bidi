# WebDriver BiDi for Chromium

This is an implementation of the [WebDriver BiDi](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver-bidi/) protocol for Chromium, implemented as a JavaScript layer translating between BiDi and CDP, running inside a Chrome tab.

Current status can be checked here: [Chromium BiDi progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1acM-kHlubpwnW1mFboS9hePawq3u1kf21oQzD16q-Ao/edit?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-PuLHQYLmDJUOXH_mFO-QiA).

## Setup

This is a Node.js project, so install dependencies as usual:

    npm install

## Starting the Server

    npm run server

This will run the server on port 8080. Use the `PORT` environment variable or `--port=...` argument to run it on another port:

    PORT=8081 npm run server
    npm run server -- --port=8081

Use the `DEBUG` environment variable to see debug info:

    DEBUG=* npm run server

Use the CLI argument `--headless=false` to run browser in headful mode:

    npm run server -- --headless=false

### Starting on Linux and Mac

TODO: verify if it works on Windows.

You can alson run the server by using script `./runBiDiServer.sh`. It will write output to the file `log.txt`:

    ./runBiDiServer.sh --port=8081 --headless=false

## Running the Tests

### Unit tests

Running:

    npm run unit

### e2e tests

**Note**: Most of the e2e tests currently fail, but this is how to run them.

The e2e tests are written using Python, in order to learn how to eventually do this
in web-platform-tests. Python 3.6+ and some dependencies are required:

    python3 -m pip install --user -r tests/requirements.txt

Running:

    npm run e2e

This will run the e2e tests against an already running server on port 8080. Use the `PORT` environment variable to connect to another port:

    PORT=8081 npm run e2e

## How does it work?

The architecture is described in the [WebDriver BiDi in Chrome Context implementation plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VfQ9tv0wPSnb5TI-MOobjoQ5CXLnJJx9F_PxOMQc8kY).

There are 2 main modules:

1. backend WS server in `src`. It runs webSocket server, and for each ws connection runs an instance of browser with BiDi Mapper.
2. front-end BiDi Mapper in `src/bidiMapper`. Gets BiDi commands from the backend, and map them to CDP commands.

## Contributing

The BiDi commands are processed in the `src/bidiMapper/commandProcessor.ts`. To add a new command, add it to `_processCommand`, write and call processor for it.
